                            <p>The M235i proves that BMW still has the code to driving excellence. This makes us both relieved
                                and slightly annoyed that it’s not used on a broader range of the company’s products. The
                                M235i might be a throwback, but it’s also a decidedly positive step up the evolutionary ladder.</p>

                                other beguiling shapes, even a real Italian demi-supercar, vied for our attention this year.
                                But the Stingray looks transplanted from childhood fantasy, an interstellar dragon. We hear
                                it roar, smell the heat of the LT1 cooking its own polymer skin, and the Corvette turns such
                                imaginings into reality.</p>

                            <p>With its stitched leather, matte-silver toggle switches, and faux turned-aluminum trim, this
                                in­teri­or boasts meticulousness heretofore absent from mainstream American cars. There’s
                                an element of toyishness in the sheen of some of the plastics and the Duplo-scale toggle
                                switches, but that puerile charm gets to the heart of what we love about the Mustang. It
                                reminds us that driving a great car can be play, something that even grownups enjoy.</p>

                                driven one might think that giving it a 10Best award is akin to Michelin (the restaurant-guide
                                part of the operation) giving three stars to the local McDonald’s. But the Accord is proof
                                that millions can be served, and still be served, the best.</p>

                                horsepower and driving the front wheels through Mazda’s tidy six-speed manual. The four is
                                as forthright and linear as the steering, which makes the whole car feel harmonious, matched,
                                and smooth, and not like some intemperate hot hatch. But a hot hatch is what it is. Fun fact:
                                Pigeons can hit 90 mph.</p>

                                well-finished cabin. The stand­ard 2.5-liter four-cylinder is tuned for torque and mileage
                                more than excitement, but it’s impressively economical. The optional capacitor-fitted i-ELOOP
                                energy-storage ­system paired with one of the industry’s best automatic transmissions returns
                                hybrid-like EPA numbers, reaching 40 mpg on the highway.</p>

                            <p>The Boxster and Cayman demonstrate immense mutability. They are daily drivers, luxury coupes,
                                and sports cars. Scouring our notes on the pair, we find complaints only about the cup holders.
                                The third generation of Porsche’s mid-engine platform has also widened the gap between base
                                and S models. If you’re expecting straight-line perform­ance from these corner hunters, the
                                base cars can be uncomfortably slow. The extra power of the S and GTS trims, however, transforms
                                these cars into well-rounded athletes.</p>

                            <p>Maybe that’s why it has taken Tesla some time to get us a 60-kWh Model S, two years after we
                                tested the top-of-the-line Model S P85, the one with the gargantuan battery pack and uprated
                                motor and a base price that exceeds our 10Best threshold. The 60 truncates some power and
                                range to qualify, while sacrificing nothing else. It is a rev­ela­tory machine, with possibilities
                                that are still unfolding.</p>
